# WhatHappened

Information is everywhere. But to what extend do you trust them?

Information is everywhere, but they are not well connected, at least not in a way that is relevant to the topic mostly concerned.

I wish, when I read a newspaper about an event, I could easily find the trustworthy facts. I dont need to spend too much time on finding the supporting facts.

Without the trustworthy facts, no opition, at least no unbiased opinion can be formed.
